# üñ•Ô∏èSplunk Security Monitoring Practice

## Overview
This repository showcases my hands-on experience with Splunk, focusing on security monitoring, log analysis, and alerting. This project simulates a real-world SOC (Security Operations Center) scenario for a fictional company, Virtual Space Industries (VSI), where I play the role of an SOC analyst.

# Scenario
VSI designs virtual-reality programs for businesses. Recently, rumors suggest that a competitor, JobeCorp, may attempt cyberattacks to disrupt VSI's operations. My role as an SOC analyst is to use Splunk to monitor VSI‚Äôs systems and detect potential security threats.

# üîëKey Objectives
<ul>
  <li>Load and analyze Windows Server logs to monitor VSI‚Äôs intellectual property.</li>

<li>Load and analyze Apache Server logs to track web activity and potential threats.</li>

<li>Create reports, alerts, and dashboards to visualize and respond to security incidents.</li>

<li>Install and utilize a Splunk add-on for additional monitoring capabilities.</li></ul>

# ü™µLogs Analyzed

## Windows Server Logs
<ul>
<li>Monitors VSI's critical back-end operations.</li>

<li>Helps detect unauthorized access and suspicious activity.</li></ul>

## Apache Server Logs
<ul>
<li>Tracks activity on VSI‚Äôs public-facing website: vsi-company.com.</li>

<li>Identifies potential web-based attacks, such as SQL injection and brute-force attempts.</li></ul>

# ‚úÖTasks Completed
<ol>
<li>Log Ingestion: Successfully imported Windows and Apache logs into Splunk.</li>

<li>Data Analysis: Parsed and filtered logs to identify key security events.</li>

<li>Report Generation: Created detailed reports on login attempts, error logs, and access patterns.</li>

<li>Alerting: Configured real-time alerts for suspicious activity.</li>

<li>Dashboard Creation: Developed dashboards for security visualization and monitoring.</li>

<li>Add-on Installation: Integrated additional Splunk applications to enhance monitoring capabilities.</li>
</ol>

# Tools & Technologies
<ul>
<li>Splunk Enterprise (Log analysis, dashboards, and alerts)</li>

<li>Windows Server Logs (Security events, authentication logs)</li>

<li>Apache Access & Error Logs (Web activity monitoring)</li>

<li>Splunk Add-ons (Enhanced monitoring and automation)</li></ul>

# Next Steps

Fine-tune alerts to reduce false positives.

Implement threat intelligence feeds in Splunk.

Expand log sources to include network and firewall logs.

# Conclusion
This project helped me build hands-on expertise in log analysis, threat detection, and security monitoring using Splunk. It provided valuable insights into SOC operations and real-world cybersecurity challenges.
